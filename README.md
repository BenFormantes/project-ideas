## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: Music Theory Analytics Platform

The goal of this project is to develop a platform for analyzing and looking into the music theory
of songs by utilizing machine learning algorithms to first get the individual stems of a song (like bass, vocals,
instruments, percussion) and then performing different transformations on each waveform. Plenty of sites provide
basic lyrics transcriptions or information on the chords, but often skim past deeper harmonic structure, actual chord
progressions and voicings, or song form. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform with the goal of 
concrete functionailty to compute the basic song features, such as individual song stems, determine time signature, 
key signature, BPM, develop accurate chord charts and transcribe lyrics for a basic framework of the song. 
The actual algorithms for chord recognition, stem splitting, and downbeat tracking will be implemented in Python.

The platform will also seek to provide advanced analytics to the music based on genres. Users will upload a mp3 or a wav,
and by again implementing machine learning algorithms based on common chord progressions and Roman Numeral Analysis, songs 
that follow a similar harmonic structure can be compared to provide users with different voicings (e.g. closed and shell 
voicings) or different chord substitutions and reharmonization. This functionality is dependent on scraping existing 
data on chord structures of songs to recognize common substitutions, allowing users to explore new arrangements or methods
of song production and mixes.
